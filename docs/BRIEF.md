# Project Brief: CrewForge CLI Tool

## Vision
A CLI tool that generates functional CrewAI MVPs from natural language prompts, reducing manual setup from 2-4 hours to under 10 minutes.

## User Personas
### Primary User: Solo Developer
- **Role:** Independent developer building CrewAI projects
- **Needs:** Rapid scaffolding, intelligent defaults, minimal configuration
- **Pain Points:** 2-4 hours manual setup, unclear CrewAI best practices
- **Success:** Working MVP in <10 minutes, focus on business logic not setup

### Secondary User: CrewAI Learner
- **Role:** Developer exploring CrewAI framework
- **Needs:** Structured examples, guided configuration
- **Pain Points:** Steep learning curve, configuration overwhelm
- **Success:** Practical CrewAI understanding through generated examples

## Core Requirements
- **[MVP]** Parse natural language prompts describing crew functionality
- **[MVP]** Leverage `crewai create crew <name>` for project scaffolding
- **[MVP]** Using agentic AI, Generate agent definitions (roles, goals, backstories) from prompt context
- **[MVP]** Using agentic AI, Generate task definitions (descriptions, expected outputs) from prompt context
- **[MVP]** Select and configure tools from CrewAI's library based on requirements
- **[MVP]** Wire agents, tasks, and tools into functional crew configuration
- **[MVP]** Complete full generation cycle in <10 minutes
- **[MVP]** Provide real-time progress tracking with step visibility, percentage completion, and LLM response streaming during generation
- **[MVP]** Validate generated projects execute without syntax errors
- **[MVP]** Ensure generated crews perform specified business functions
- **[MVP]** Save configured agents, tasks, and tools to refine process over time
- **[POST-MVP]** Provide interactive clarification for ambiguous prompts
- **[POST-MVP]** Suggest optimal configurations based on detected project patterns
- **[POST-MVP]** Handle edge cases through guided specification prompts
- **[POST-MVP]** Enable post-generation refinement of agents and tasks

## Success Metrics
1. **Generation Speed:** <10 minutes (prompt input to executable MVP)
2. **Syntax Success:** 95% of generated projects run without syntax errors
3. **Functional Success:** 80% of generated crews correctly execute intended business logic
4. **User Satisfaction:** 4.5/5.0 average rating for speed and code quality
